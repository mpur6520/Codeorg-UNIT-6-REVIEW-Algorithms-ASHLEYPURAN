    Lesson 1 
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we learned about algorithms while discussing about problems and coming up with solutions.
    <br><br>
   In your own words explain the difference between a problem and an algorithm.
    <br><br>
    An algorithm creates a solution to the problem. The problem is the reason that the algorithm is created, in order to come up with a solution within a reasonable time.

    Lesson 2 
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we learned more about different types of algorithm speeds and how to classify them. We learned about reasonable and unreasonable types.
    <br><br>
    What is the third step using Binary Search to look for the number 32 in this list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 16, 25, 32, 33, 45, 47, 51, 69, 75]
    <br><br>
    Compare the number 33 to the given number.
  </div>
  <div class="wave" id="L3"> 
    Lesson 3 
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we learned more about reasonable and unreasonable algorithms while comparing the two's computing powers.
    <br><br>
    Which of the follow efficiencies would be considered unreasonable?
    <br><br>
    2^n
    <br><br>
    A team of programmers is trying to determine the efficiency of a piece of code. They run the code with inputs of different sizes and also record the number of iterations through the core block of code. The data is recorded in the table below.
    <br><br>
    <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Input Size</th>
       <th>Iterations</th>
     </tr> 
    <tr>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>400</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>600</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>40</td>
      <td>800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>50</td>
      <td>1000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>2000</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <br><br>
    Based on the data provided, does this algorithm run in a reasonable or unreasonable time? Explain your answer.
    <br><br>
    This algorithm runs in a reasonable time because it doesn't grow exponentially, instead at a fixed rate. The rate is 20 times the input size, so it's not exponential.

    Lesson 4 
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we took a look at different problems and figured out how computer scientists would tackle them differently. We learned about heuristic approaches, too.
    <br><br>
    In which of the following situations is it most appropriate to use a heuristic solution?
    <br><br>
     The only algorithms that provide exact solutions run in unreasonable time but exact solutions are not necessary
    <br><br>
    Problems that are undecidable and algorithms that are unreasonable both touch on the limits of the kinds of computing that a computer can accomplish. In your own words, explain the difference between undecidable problems and unreasonable time algorithms.
    <br><br>
    Undecidable problems are problems that physically no algorithm is able to solve with a solution, no matter what. An unreasonable time algorithm is one where there is a solution that can be made, but the time it takes to run that program is too much for the input size.

  <div class="wave" id="L5"> 
    Lesson 5
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we learned about different advantages and disadvantages to using certain approaches to problems.
    <br><br>
    There is no hard-and-fast rule as to which is better, but what do you think? What kinds of circumstances would lead you to writing a function versus using a loop?
    <br><br>
    I would probably use a loop when I don't know how many times I need a function to be repeated, or when I would have to place multiple of the same functions in a row.
    <br><br>
    An algorithm was initially written sequentially. Later it was determined that a parallel solution was possible and so the algorithm rewritten. The times to run each version of the algorithm are included in the table below.
    <br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Algorithm Type</th>
        <th>Time</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sequential</td>
        <td>30 mins</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Parallel</td>
        <td>10 mins</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br><br>
    What is the speedup of this parallel solution?
    <br><br>
    3.
    <br><br>
    Parallel algorithms typically will be faster than sequential algorithms, and as you run the process on more computers it will continue to grow faster. In your own words, explain why the speedup of a parallel algorithm will eventually reach some limit.
    <br><br>
    The speedup of a parallel algorithm will eventually reach a limit because with each computer used, the speedup gradually decreases. It will reach a point that the speedup reaches a limit.
